# Internship at Eskalate

During my internship at Eskalate, I was involved in multiple projects designed to enhance our understanding of Clean Architecture and best practices in software development. One of the key components of our onboarding process was the **onboarding folder**, which contains various files related to the projects we undertook.

## Onboarding Folder Overview

The onboarding folder serves as a repository for the projects we worked on, each aimed at reinforcing our knowledge of Clean Architecture principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Flutter development. This folder includes:

- **Project Files**: Each project within the folder demonstrates different aspects of Clean Architecture, showcasing how to structure Flutter applications for maintainability and scalability.
- **Documentation**: Detailed notes and guidelines on implementing Clean Architecture, best practices, and insights gained throughout our projects.
- **Sample Codegit**: Code snippets and examples that illustrate key concepts and patterns relevant to our work, making it easier for new interns to understand and apply these principles.

Through this internship, I gained valuable hands-on experience in software development and learned how to effectively apply architectural principles in real-world applications.
